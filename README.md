# GODM
Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Google Gemini as the Large Language Model (LLM) to develop a Movie recommendation AI that processes entries in a database to create vector embeddings, getting user query and also embedding it and using semantic search to search the query against previously created plot embeddings, enabling it to provide accurate and context-aware response.

Integrating MongoDB using its official driver to establish a connection with a Go Gin server, facilitating seamless CRUD operations for efficient data management.
